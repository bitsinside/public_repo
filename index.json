[{"content":"Introduction Since starting my homelab journey in December of this year, I\u0026rsquo;ve been attempting to self-host certain services that I find useful in my daily life.\nHere I wanto to share the list of service that I am self host.\nMy mini homelab My home lab setup currently consists of three primary components, a Mikrotik hEX S (poor man\u0026rsquo;s router), an old laptop (which I used to self-host stuff before purchasing Raspberry Pi), and a Raspberry Pi 5 named Devtest.\nAbout Devtest Devtest is where most services run. The majority of the services running on Devtest are in Docker containers. I also attached a 1TB hard disk, which I\u0026rsquo;m utilizing as NAS.\nService on Devtest\nDocker - platform to run containers Wiki.js - for documentation purpose Tailscale - VPN to access my homelab tcptunnel - It\u0026rsquo;s a small service that I wrote in C to portforward internal services to external ones using tailscale. NMS - A network monitoring service that I wrote in C, Go Lang, and SQLite that will scan IP/MAC addresses on a periodic basis and display device lists in a dashboard (not fully finished yet), so it will accomplish the job that I planned. Currently, it runs on a Docker container. About an old Laptop Old laptop runs Ubuntu OS and I use it for coding and browsing, It also has tailscale node, where I can access my laptop\u0026rsquo;s internal services remotely vai my Phone.\nConclusion Overall, I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying my homelab and self-hosting, and I\u0026rsquo;m forward to explore more in the coming year(s). Until next time, happy homelabbing ðŸ––.\n","permalink":"https://0xmm.in/posts/helloworld/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince starting my homelab journey in December of this year, I\u0026rsquo;ve been attempting to self-host certain services that I find useful in my daily life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere I wanto to share the list of service that I am self host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-mini-homelab\"\u003eMy mini homelab\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy home lab setup currently consists of three primary components, a Mikrotik \u003ca href=\"https://mikrotik.com/product/hex_s\"\u003ehEX S\u003c/a\u003e (poor man\u0026rsquo;s router), an old laptop (which I used to self-host stuff before purchasing Raspberry Pi), and a Raspberry Pi 5 named \u003ccode\u003eDevtest\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Hello World"}]
